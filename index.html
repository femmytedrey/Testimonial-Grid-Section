                        <p class="normal">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VE startup."</p>

                    <p class="normal1">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've referred to it during interviews as an example of my develpment experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
